# Skeddit
*EECS448*

Skeddit is a modular event planner and scheduler created in Ruby on Rails. Its simplistic design makes it easy to navigate, create, view, join, and manage your events. Skeddit supports account creation, and it can run on any machine with access to the same database, and find the same events.
